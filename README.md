# Galactic-Escapade
I recently found an old CD containing a past project of mine. During high school, my friends and I decided to try to make a video game (without an editor), this is that game. This space adventure, puts you the user into a galactic escapade. You are the astronaut that can save not only earth but humanity as a whole. Check out my first attempt at a video game.
